This code book describes the variables, the data in the cleaned tidy dataset "tidy_data.txt" and any transformations performed to obtain this dataset.
# Data
The first row of "tidy_data.txt" contains the names of the 68 variables, including two identifier variables and 66 feature variables.
The second to 181th rows are the actual data. Each row contains a subject ID, an activity name, and 66 floating point values bounded within [-1,1]. Each floating point value is the mean measurement of one feature pertaining to a specific group determined by a subject ID and an activity name.
# Variables
- Identifiers
    - subjectID: Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.
    - activityname: Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values:

      - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
      - SITTING: subject was sitting

# Transformations 
Transformations applied to the source data:
    - The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
    - The measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
    - The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with actual activity names.
    - The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeBodyAccelerometer-Mean-X), using the following set of rules:
        - Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
        - The initial f and t were expanded to Frequency and Time,respectively.
        - Acc, Gyro, Mag were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, respectively.
        - The redundant "BodyBody" were replaced with "Body".
        - The final data set was created with the mean of each of 66 feature variables in each group determined by the combinations of subject IDs and activity names.
